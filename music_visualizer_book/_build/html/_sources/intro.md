<h3 style="margin-top: 5px;">Album Covers Come Alive</h3>

The combination of music and visual arts has become prevalent in the modern music industry, from music videos to concert visuals, in an attempt to enhance the music listening experience. Music visualization is a difficult task to approach and evaluate, as music is a complex form of art combining contextual and emotional information, and it's interpretation is largely subjective. It can range from being strictly representational of the musical content, to more abstract context and emotion based.

This work explores the possibility of using **Generative text-to-video** models, and more specifically **Generative text-to-video Diffusion Models**, to create music visualizations with the goal of enhancing the musical experience for the listener. 

We introduce a free-to-use and easily accessible Music Visualization tool which we call **Deforum Music Visualizer**, based on **Deforum Stable Diffusion**, an open-source **Generative text-to-video** model. 

The tool is available here:
